# HR-Analytics-In-depth-EDA-Machine-Learning-with-Hyperparameter-Tuning
This project focuses on exploring employee data through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by building predictive models for employee attrition.  Includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple ML algorithms.
# HR Analytics: In-depth EDA & Machine Learning with Hyperparameter Tuning

## üìä Project Overview
Employee attrition is one of the most critical challenges faced by organizations. This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and applies **Machine Learning models** with **hyperparameter tuning** to predict employee attrition and gain insights into the factors driving it.

The analysis covers:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Comprehensive EDA (visual & statistical insights)
- Feature selection & engineering
- Predictive modeling using ML algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy
- Model evaluation & comparison

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used: **HR_Employee_Data.xlsx**

Key features include:
- Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Education, etc.)
- Job-related information (Role, Department, Salary, Experience, etc.)
- Performance metrics & work-life balance
- Attrition status (Target variable)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data handling)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning models & tuning)
- **XGBoost / RandomForest** (Advanced models)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## üß† Machine Learning Models
The following models were tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Hyperparameter tuning** was performed using GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV.

---

## üìà Key Insights
- Identified major factors influencing attrition such as **Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Salary Hike, and Overtime**.
- Visualized correlations and distributions for better HR decision-making.
- Achieved improved prediction accuracy after hyperparameter optimization.
